## About

This is a barebones template. 

There is no sass for styling and no templating components.

### Basic Features

- All the fancy javascript shit that made webpack good in the firstplace: ie: c o d e s p l i t t i n g

The loaders used are

- webpack dev server
- html-loading
- babel
- mini-css-extract plugin because the previous css plugin didn't work with webpack 4
